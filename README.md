This company fullstack web app contains CRUD operations.

# How to run it
You should have a mongodb working well.
First type, npm i in both parent directory and the view folder to install packages.

 For frontend, you have to go in view folder(cd view), then type, npm run dev.

 For backend, you will run it in the parent directory, then type npm run dev. You should also have .env file to use mongo_uri which I have put in .env for security reasons

 You will be redirected easily to the page where you will add some data. you will also be able to go to the file where you will see the file containing saved data.
